# Endless-Cat-Runner

Even though I don't really like hypercasual games, I always thought about how fast I could make one.
Due to my girlfriend's love for cats and her request for me to make a game for her, I created this game in just 2 days.
Honestly it turned out to be quite enjoyable. I carefully chose the music and sounds, paying attention to detail.

**Features:**

- Cat
- Endless randomized platforms and collectibles
- Highscore system
- Object pooling
- Chipi chipi chapa chapa
